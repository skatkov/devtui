## Install
Through homebrew:
```
brew install skatkov/tap/devtui
```

Or download executable from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/skatkov/homebrew-tap/releases?q=devtui&expanded=true)

## Requirements
With **OSX** everything should work out of the box.

On Linux, **Wayland** requires `wl-clipboard` and **X11** requires `xclip` or `xsel` to be installed. If you are not sure, what you use.

```
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
# wayland or X11
```

Windows should work, but currently is not tested. If you want to help you with that, please reach out.
