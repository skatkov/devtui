## 📚 Documentation Generator

DevTUI includes automated documentation generators for both CLI and TUI interfaces (not complete yet, though).

### Generate All Documentation
To regenerate both CLI and TUI documentation:

```bash
cd docs && go run *.go
```

This will:
- Generate CLI documentation in `site/cli/` with proper Jekyll front matter
- Generate TUI documentation in `site/tui/` with key bindings and usage instructions
- Clean up auto-generated content (remove footers, SEE ALSO sections, etc.)
- Apply proper formatting and language hints for code examples

### Individual Generators
You can also run generators separately:

```bash
# CLI documentation only
cd docs && go run cli-docs.go docs.go

# TUI documentation only
cd docs && go run tui-docs.go docs.go
```
